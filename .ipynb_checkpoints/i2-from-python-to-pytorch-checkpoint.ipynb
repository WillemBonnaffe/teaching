    "This is addressed to biologists who are looking to make their first steps in Python and would like to know how their knowledge of R commands translates into Python.\n",
    "I was in this position not long ago and remember well the frustration of having to repeatedly look up how to execute even the most basic R operations in Python.\n",
    "I have now mapped my R vocabulary onto Python.\n",
    "This repository is effectively the resource that I would like to pass onto my past self.\n",

    "I should mention that this notebook takes a particularly minimalistic stance on coding.\n",
    "It is not intended to teach you the most pythonic way to code in Python.\n",
    "It is geared towards a bare bones style of coding by focussing on the most basic functions.\n",
    "As such, this notebook does not cover advanced dataframe and plotting operations, nor does it cover how to perform the satistical modelling that we love R for.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you follow the steps provided in this notebook, you should acquire a highly functional knowledge of Python.\n",
    "This will be a particulary suitable base from which to build up on and explore modelling, optimisation, and machine learning in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, why not use ChatGPT? \n",
    "Why do we need yet another Python tutorial in the era of LLMs? \n",
    "First, I will say that LLMs do a perfect job at translating code from one language to another. \n",
    "However, without a good understanding of the target language, we are incapable to alter the output, and therefore remain dependent on LLMs for completing our projects, which I think is obviously not desirable."
